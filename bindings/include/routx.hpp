/**
 * Sets a logging handler for the library.
 *
 * The `callback` function will be called whenever the library wants to log something.
 * Routx makes two types of logs:
 *
 * - warnings with target=`routx::osm`, informing about issues with OSM data;
 *
 * - errors with target=`routx`, informing about input issues or failures within the library.
 *
 * Dependencies of routx technically could also make any logging calls, but they don't
 * seem to do so.
 *
 * The logging levels numbers generally correspond to [Python Logging
 * Levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels), that is:
 *
 * - 50 for critical failures (not used in Rust's log crate),
 *
 * - 40 for errors,
 *
 * - 30 for warnings,
 *
 * - 20 for info,
 *
 * - 10 for debug,
 *
 * - 5 for trace.
 *
 * This function leaks a small amount of memory allocated for the logging adapter.
 * It is advisable to only call this function once.
 *
 * @param callback function to call on a logging message, or NULL to disable logging.
 *     `arg` parameter is passed through as-is, `level` represents message severity (described
 * above), `target` describes briefly who made the logging call (e.g. `routx`), and `message` is
 * the actual log message.
 * @param flush_callback function to call when the library wants to flush any buffered log
 * messages, or NULL if no flushing is needed. `arg` parameter is passed through as-is. Currently
 * not used.
 * @param arg user-provided argument passed to `callback` and `flush_callback` calls
 * @param min_level minimum logging level to report. Messages with a lower level will be ignored.
 *    Recommended value is 30 to only see warnings and errors.
